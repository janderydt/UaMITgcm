# uamitgcm
This repository contains:
* Operational Ua-MITgcm configurations that have been published somewhere, as well as the code to reproduce the results and figures in those papers
* New, unpublished configuration for development and sharing before they are transferred to the [UaMITgcm main branch](https://github.com/knaughten/UaMITgcm).
* A library of Matlab tools to plot Ua-MITgcm output
* A [Wiki](https://github.com/janderydt/UaMITgcm_development/wiki) on how to setup ARCHER2 for UaMITgcm, and a basic tutorial on how to run UaMITgcm jobs.
